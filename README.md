# Advanced Robot Control

This is a repository for Advanced Robot Control laboratory classes taken at Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology.
This code was developed as part of lab assignments based on templates and tasks provided by Wojciech Domski, PhD.

## Contents:
- **3RMatlab** - scripts in Matlab to simulate 3R rigid manipulator. The goal was to implement input-output decoupling algorithm.
- **staticLin** - static linearization implemented in Python for trajectory tracking of unicycle mobile platform.
- **MPC** - Model Predictive Control algorithm implemented in Python for trajectory tracking of a unicycle.
- **FreeRTOS** - implementation of tasks, mutexes, event groups and queues for FreeRTOS in C.
- **PID** - implementation of PID controller in FreeRTOS.
